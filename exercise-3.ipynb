Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision.\n","\"\"\".replace('.','').replace('.','').replace('(','').replace(')','').split()"],"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8PufzlaOD2bp","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1613785417053,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":330,"user":{"displayName":"Ojaswi Dhoubhadel","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjk3OnSPDc1uQhfMW3FBpomzJ6GO3jVp0HlKO4XmUg=s64","userId":"06018964124818252092"}},"outputId":"4e7030ba-d688-40d0-956a-9d92206f9d77"},"source":["dicti = {}\n","for word in list_of_words:\n","  if word in dicti:\n","    dicti[word] +=1\n","  else:\n","    dicti[word] = 1\n","\n","dicti"],"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'\"learn\"': 1,\n"," '1959': 1,\n"," 'Arthur': 1,\n"," 'Machine': 3,\n"," 'Samuel': 1,\n"," 'The': 1,\n"," 'a': 4,\n"," 'ability': 1,\n"," 'algorithms': 3,\n"," 'and': 4,\n"," 'applications': 1,\n"," 'being': 1,\n"," 'building': 1,\n"," 'by': 2,\n"," 'can': 1,\n"," 'coined': 1,\n"," 'computer': 3,\n"," 'computing': 1,\n"," 'construction': 1,\n"," 'data': 1,\n"," 'data,': 1,\n"," 'data-driven': 1,\n"," 'decisions,': 1,\n"," 'designing': 1,\n"," 'detection': 1,\n"," 'difficult': 1,\n"," 'eg,': 1,\n"," 'email': 1,\n"," 'employed': 1,\n"," 'example': 1,\n"," 'explicit': 1,\n"," 'explicitly': 1,\n"," 'explores': 1,\n"," 'field': 1,\n"," 'filtering,': 1,\n"," 'following': 1,\n"," 'from': 2,\n"," 'give': 1,\n"," 'good': 1,\n"," 'improve': 1,\n"," 'in': 2,\n"," 'include': 1,\n"," 'infeasible;': 1,\n"," 'inputs': 1,\n"," 'instructions': 1,\n"," 'intruders,': 1,\n"," 'is': 3,\n"," 'learn': 1,\n"," 'learning': 4,\n"," 'machine': 1,\n"," 'make': 1,\n"," 'making': 1,\n"," 'model': 1,\n"," 'name': 1,\n"," 'network': 1,\n"," 'of': 4,\n"," 'on': 2,\n"," 'or': 2,\n"," 'overcome': 1,\n"," 'performance': 2,\n"," 'predictions': 2,\n"," 'program': 1,\n"," 'programmed': 1,\n"," 'programming': 1,\n"," 'progressively': 1,\n"," 'range': 1,\n"," 'sample': 1,\n"," 'science': 1,\n"," 'specific': 1,\n"," 'static': 1,\n"," 'statistical': 1,\n"," 'strictly': 1,\n"," 'study': 1,\n"," 'such': 1,\n"," 'systems': 1,\n"," 'task': 1,\n"," 'tasks': 1,\n"," 'techniques': 1,\n"," 'that': 2,\n"," 'the': 2,\n"," 'through': 1,\n"," 'to': 2,\n"," 'uses': 1,\n"," 'vision': 1,\n"," 'was': 1,\n"," 'where': 1,\n"," 'with': 2,\n"," 'without': 1,\n"," '–': 1}"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uIRI0wZrFdWN"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
